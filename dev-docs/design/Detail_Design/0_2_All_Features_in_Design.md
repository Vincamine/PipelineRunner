# **CI/CD System: Covered Features Checklist**

* **Author**: Yiwen Wang
* **Version**: 1.0
* **Last Updated**: Mar 4, 2025

## **Overview**
This document outlines the verification of our CI/CD system design against the project requirements. The table below confirms that all essential features have been covered in the design.

## **1. Covered Features in Design**

| **Requirement**                                    | **Covered in Design?** | **Notes** |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| **Pipeline Execution**                            | ✅ Yes | CLI triggers execution, backend manages pipeline & worker execution |
| **Stage & Job Execution with Dependency Handling**| ✅ Yes | Enforces dependencies, sequential stages, parallel jobs where possible |
| **Execution State Management** (`Pending`, `Running`, `Success`, `Failed`, `Canceled`) | ✅ Yes | Defined in execution design and properly handled in API |
| **Job Failure Handling (`allow_failure` flag)** | ✅ Yes | Stops pipeline unless explicitly allowed |
| **Job Cancellation Mechanism** | ✅ Yes | Implemented `CANCELED` state when pipeline is stopped early |
| **Duplicate Execution Detection** | ✅ Yes | Backend detects identical execution requests and avoids redundant runs |
| **Configuration File Validation (`--check`, `--dry-run`)** | ✅ Yes | CLI validates YAML syntax, detects cycles, and prints execution order |
| **Cycle Detection in Job Dependencies** | ✅ Yes | Using graph-based cycle detection (DFS/Kahn's Algorithm) |
| **Artifact Uploading** | ✅ Yes | API and execution flow handle saving artifacts post-job execution |
| **Execution Logs Storage (Separate from Reports)** | ✅ Yes | Logs are stored separately for debugging, available via API |
| **Execution Tracking & Reporting** | ✅ Yes | CLI fetches execution history via API, with pipeline/stage/job granularity |
| **CLI Local Execution Support** | ✅ Yes | CLI allows local runs, ensuring no external dependencies required |
| **Offline Storage for Local Runs** | ✅ Yes | Backend and CLI manage separate storage for local executions |
| **Branch & Commit Hash Handling in CLI** | ✅ Yes | CLI auto-fetches the latest commit unless overridden by user |
| **Config Overrides in CLI (`--override`)** | ✅ Yes | CLI allows users to modify YAML config dynamically before execution |
| **Git Validation Before Execution** | ✅ Yes | System verifies execution is inside a Git repository |
| **Error Handling & Debugging Support** | ✅ Yes | CLI prints clear error messages with file/line references |

## **2. Potential Enhancements**
While all core requirements have been met, a few additional features could enhance the system:

1. **Permission & Access Control for Pipelines**
    - Implement authentication/authorization for triggering runs in production.
    - Restrict user access for job cancellations and re-running pipelines.

2. **Scalability Considerations**
    - Ensure support for thousands of concurrent executions.
    - Implement worker load balancing for high-performance pipelines.

3. **Logging & Debugging Enhancements**
    - Enable real-time log streaming for monitoring active job execution.
    - Define retention policies for execution logs.

4. **Notifications & Alerts**
    - Introduce webhook-based notifications or email alerts for failed jobs.
    - Consider Slack/Discord integrations for real-time CI/CD status updates.

## **3. Final Verdict**
✅ **The CI/CD system fully meets the core requirements** outlined in the project specification.  
💡 **Optional Enhancements** can be considered for future scalability and usability improvements.
