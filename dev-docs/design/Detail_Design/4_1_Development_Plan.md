* **Author**: Yiwen Wang
* **Version**: 1.0
* **Last Updated**: Mar 4, 2025

## **1. Development Phases Overview**
The development of the CI/CD system will be structured into multiple phases, ensuring modularity, testability, and iterative improvements.

| **Phase** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** | Core Project Setup & Architecture Definition |
| **Phase 2** | CLI Development (Basic Pipeline Execution) |
| **Phase 3** | Backend Services (Execution Engine & Worker API) |
| **Phase 4** | Worker Module Implementation (Job Execution) |
| **Phase 5** | Report & Log Management Features |
| **Phase 6** | Optimization & Enhancements |
| **Phase 7** | Testing & Deployment |

## **2. Phase-wise Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Project Setup & Architecture Definition**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Establish the foundational structure and development environment.*

- Setup **Gradle multi-module** project structure.
- Define **common interfaces, data models, and API contracts**.
- Implement **GitUtils** for repo validation & metadata retrieval.
- Implement basic **logging framework** (`CicdLogger`).
- Define initial **database schema** and repositories.

âœ… **Verification:**
- Ensure correct project structure by running `gradle build`.
- Test `GitUtils` with different repositories.
- Verify logs are stored properly in the logging framework.
- Validate database schema with migration scripts.

---

### **Phase 2: CLI Development (Basic Pipeline Execution)**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Implement CLI commands for triggering pipelines.*

- Implement `xx run` command for pipeline execution.
- Implement `xx --check` for pipeline validation.
- Implement `xx --dry-run` to show execution order.
- Validate **YAML schema & job dependencies** in the CLI.
- Implement **local execution mode**.

âœ… **Verification:**
- Run `xx --check` with a valid/invalid pipeline and check error reporting.
- Run `xx --dry-run` and verify correct execution order.
- Execute `xx run --local` and confirm local execution.

---

### **Phase 3: Backend Services (Execution Engine & Worker API)**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Implement backend logic for handling pipeline execution.*

- Implement **PipelineExecutionService** for execution requests.
- Implement **JobScheduler** to assign jobs to workers.
- Implement API:
    - `/api/pipeline/execute`
    - `/api/pipeline/status/{executionId}`
    - `/api/job/execute`

âœ… **Verification:**
- Trigger `/api/pipeline/execute` and check if the pipeline is stored in DB.
- Query `/api/pipeline/status/{executionId}` and ensure the response matches execution state.
- Assign jobs via `/api/job/execute` and check worker logs.

---

### **Phase 4: Worker Module Implementation (Job Execution)**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Implement the Worker module for executing jobs in Docker containers.*

- Implement **WorkerController** to receive job assignments.
- Implement **DockerManager** to run jobs in isolated containers.
- Implement job execution lifecycle:
    - Queuing, Running, Completing, Handling Failures.
- Implement **JobStatusUpdate** API (`/api/job/status`).
- Implement **dependency resolution** for job execution.

âœ… **Verification:**
- Trigger job execution and ensure a container is started.
- Check `/api/job/status` updates as the job progresses.
- Verify job dependencies are honored in execution order.

---

### **Phase 5: Report & Log Management Features**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Implement reporting & logging for pipeline executions.*

- Implement `/api/report/pipeline/{pipelineName}` for execution history.
- Implement `/api/report/pipeline/{pipelineName}/stage/{stageName}`.
- Implement `/api/report/pipeline/{pipelineName}/stage/{stageName}/job/{jobName}`.
- Implement **execution logs storage** separately from reports.
- Implement CLI `xx report` command for fetching execution summaries.

âœ… **Verification:**
- Run `xx report --pipeline <name>` and check if the correct history is fetched.
- Retrieve logs separately and confirm reports do not include execution logs.
- Validate DB stores logs correctly and can retrieve past execution summaries.

---

### **Phase 6: Optimization & Enhancements**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Improve efficiency, handle edge cases, and optimize system performance.*

- Implement **Job Cancellation API** (`/api/job/cancel`).
- Implement **Duplicate Execution Detection** to prevent redundant runs.
- Optimize **parallel execution** for independent jobs.
- Implement **offline storage for local execution**.
- Optimize **pipeline failure handling** (graceful shutdown of pending jobs).

âœ… **Verification:**
- Cancel a job via `/api/job/cancel` and confirm proper termination.
- Submit duplicate execution requests and ensure only one runs.
- Validate independent jobs run in parallel where dependencies allow.
- Execute `xx run --local` offline and verify storage persists execution state.

---

### **Phase 7: Testing & Deployment**
ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Ensure stability, scalability, and prepare for deployment.*

- Implement **unit tests for all modules**.
- Implement **integration tests for API & worker**.
- Perform **load testing** to assess system performance.
- Deploy system in a **staging environment**.
- Conduct **final user acceptance testing**.

âœ… **Verification:**
- Run `gradle test` and confirm all unit tests pass.
- Execute API integration tests and verify expected responses.
- Simulate high job load and measure system performance.
- Deploy in a staging environment and conduct end-to-end testing.

## **3. Risk Management & Challenges**
| **Risk** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **YAML validation complexity** | Use schema validation & structured error reporting. |
| **Dependency cycle detection overhead** | Optimize using DFS-based graph processing. |
| **Worker resource contention** | Implement job queuing and concurrency limits. |
| **Handling large-scale pipelines** | Implement distributed job scheduling & execution tracking. |
| **Ensuring fast job execution in Docker** | Optimize container startup time & caching mechanisms. |

---

## **4. Conclusion**
This development plan provides a structured **milestone-based approach**, ensuring that each phase is verifiable and aligned with system requirements. ðŸš€
