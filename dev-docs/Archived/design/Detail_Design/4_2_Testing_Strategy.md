## **Overview**
This document outlines the unit testing and integration testing strategy for the CI/CD system. It defines the scope, tools, execution timing, and verification steps to ensure software reliability and maintainability.

## **1. Testing Types and Scope**

| **Test Type**      | **Scope**  | **Purpose** | **Tools/Frameworks** |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Unit Tests** | Individual classes, services (e.g., JobService, PipelineService) | Validate business logic and method-level correctness | JUnit, Mockito, AssertJ |
| **Integration Tests** | API interactions, Database transactions, Worker ↔ Backend communication | Verify correct interactions between modules | Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers, Postman |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** | Full execution flow (CLI → Backend → Worker → DB) | Validate overall system functionality | Cucumber, Selenium (optional for UI) |

---

## **2. Unit Testing Strategy**

### **2.1. What Unit Tests Cover**
- Individual **methods, classes, and services** in isolation.
- Business logic validation (e.g., job execution logic in `JobService`).
- Error handling and edge case validation.
- Mocking dependencies to isolate logic (**Mockito**).

### **2.2. When to Execute Unit Tests?**
- During **development** (Test-Driven Development (TDD) recommended).
- Before merging code into the main branch (**PR approval requirement**).
- When **fixing bugs** (write regression tests).

### **2.3. How to Verify Unit Tests?**
- **Code coverage** should meet a reasonable threshold (80%+ for critical logic).
- Test edge cases, boundary conditions, and failure scenarios.
- Run tests automatically in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## **3. Integration Testing Strategy**

### **3.1. What Integration Tests Cover**
- **API interactions** (e.g., Backend ↔ Worker ↔ CLI).
- **Database operations** (validate persistence layer transactions).
- **External dependencies** (e.g., Dockerized job execution).

### **3.2. When to Execute Integration Tests?**
- **After completing individual feature development.**
- **Before merging a new feature branch into the main branch.**
- **Before deployment to staging/production.**

### **3.3. How to Verify Integration Tests?**
- Validate API request/response structure.
- Ensure database records are updated correctly.
- Use **Postman API tests**, **Spring Boot Test**, and **Testcontainers** to replicate real-world execution.

---

## **4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy**

### **4.1. What E2E Tests Cover**
- **Full execution workflow**: CLI → Backend → Worker → Database.
- **Real-world execution of jobs within Docker containers.**
- **Verifying that pipeline execution follows expected behavior.**

### **4.2. When to Execute E2E Tests?**
- **Before major releases or staging deployments.**
- **For critical regression testing before updates.**

### **4.3. How to Verify E2E Tests?**
- Execute real CI/CD workflows using **Cucumber** or **Selenium (for UI tests, if applicable).**
- Validate job execution logs and pipeline completion status.
- Ensure all expected outputs (e.g., reports, logs, artifacts) are correctly generated.

## **5. Automated Testing in CI/CD Pipeline**

| **Testing Stage** | **Trigger** | **Tools Used** | **Pass Criteria** |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Unit Tests** | On every commit & PR | JUnit, Mockito | 80%+ coverage, all tests pass |
| **Integration Tests** | After feature completion, before merging to `main` | Spring Boot Test, Postman | API calls succeed, DB updates correctly |
| **E2E Tests** | Before release/staging | Cucumber, CLI automated tests | Entire pipeline runs successfully |

---

## **6. Conclusion**

This testing strategy ensures robustness by validating individual components through **unit tests**, verifying module interactions via **integration tests**, and guaranteeing end-to-end system correctness through **E2E tests**. Automation in CI/CD ensures continuous quality enforcement.
