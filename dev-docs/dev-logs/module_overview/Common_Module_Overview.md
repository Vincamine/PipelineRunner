# **Common Module Overview**

- **Version:** 1.0

## **1. Introduction**
The `common` module serves as the **core shared component** of the CI/CD pipeline system. It contains **data models and API contracts** used by other modules, including:
- **`backend`** ‚Üí Orchestration and execution control.
- **`worker`** ‚Üí Actual execution of jobs.
- **`cli`** ‚Üí User interaction and command execution.

The `common` module ensures **consistency** across different components and enables **modular development**.

## **2. Overview of Key Components**
### **üîπ Model (`common.model`)**
This package contains **data structures** representing core CI/CD concepts:

| **Class**               | **Description** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| `PipelineDefinition`    | Defines a pipeline configuration (stages, global variables). |
| `StageDefinition`       | Defines a single stage within a pipeline, containing jobs. |
| `JobDefinition`         | Represents a **static job configuration** (image, script, dependencies). |
| `PipelineExecution`     | Tracks an **active** pipeline execution. |
| `StageExecution`        | Tracks an **active** stage execution. |
| `JobExecution`         | Tracks an **active** job execution (status, timestamps, etc.). |
| `ExecutionState`        | **Unified enum** for execution statuses of pipelines, stages, and jobs. |
| `JobStatusUpdate`       | Used to update the status of a running job. |

**üîπ Execution State (`ExecutionState` Enum)**
- Replaces multiple status enums across the system.
- Ensures **consistent status tracking** across pipelines, stages, and jobs.
- Possible values:
    - `PENDING`
    - `RUNNING`
    - `SUCCESS`
    - `FAILED`
    - `CANCELED`
    - `UNKNOWN`

### **üîπ API (`common.api`)**
This package contains **API request/response objects** that facilitate communication between different components.

| **Class**                    | **Purpose** |
|------------------------------|------------|
| `RunPipelineRequest`         | Sent to the backend to start a pipeline execution. |
| `PipelineCheckResponse`      | Response from a pipeline validation check. |
| `JobRequest`                 | Represents a request to **run a job** (Docker image, commands, etc.). |
| `JobResponse`                | Contains execution results of a job (exit code, logs, artifacts). |
| `JobStatusUpdate`            | Used to **update job status** (`ExecutionState`). |
| `WorkerRegistrationRequest`  | Sent when a new worker registers to the system. |
| `WorkerRegistrationResponse` | Response confirming worker registration success/failure. |

## **3. Execution Flow & Responsibilities**
### **üîπ How the Common Module Works in CI/CD Execution**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Pipeline Execution**
- The backend **loads** `PipelineDefinition` from the repository YAML.
- `PipelineExecution` is created to **track execution progress**.
- `StageExecution` and `JobExecution` objects are initialized for each stage/job.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Job Execution**
- A `JobRequest` is **sent to a worker**.
- The worker **executes the job** using the provided Docker image and commands.
- The worker sends a `JobStatusUpdate` with an `ExecutionState` as the job progresses.
- Once completed, the worker sends a `JobResponse` back to the backend.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Status Updates & Completion**
- `PipelineExecution` and `StageExecution` **update their statuses** based on job results.
- If all jobs complete successfully, the pipeline transitions to `SUCCESS`.
- If a job fails (and `allowFailure=false`), the pipeline transitions to `FAILED`.

## **4. Key Design Principles**
‚úÖ **Separation of Concerns** ‚Üí API models separate from execution models.  
‚úÖ **Standardized Communication** ‚Üí API files enforce consistency across modules.  
‚úÖ **Scalability** ‚Üí The design allows adding more job types, execution strategies, and reporting mechanisms.  
‚úÖ **Unified Execution Tracking** ‚Üí The `ExecutionState` enum standardizes status handling across **pipelines, stages, and jobs**.  
‚úÖ **Flexibility** ‚Üí Job execution is **decoupled** from pipeline orchestration, allowing for future **distributed execution**.

## **5. Summary**
- The **common module** is the **foundation** of the CI/CD system.
- It defines **data structures** for pipelines, stages, and jobs.
- It provides **API contracts** for communication between the backend and workers.
- It ensures **consistency and reusability** across the entire CI/CD system.
- The introduction of `ExecutionState` **unifies status tracking** across all execution components.

üöÄ **With this structure, the system supports efficient, modular, and scalable CI/CD execution.**
