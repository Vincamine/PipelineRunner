# What worked this week?

- **We planned earlier in the week.**  
  This gave us more time to discuss tasks, allocate work, and adjust as needed.

- **We created rulesets to allow only PRs with approval to merge into the main branch.**  
  This helped maintain code quality and ensured that every change was reviewed before merging.

- **We fully used issues and PR requests throughout the process.**  
  This improved organization, making it easier to track progress and collaborate efficiently.

- **Communication was smooth.**  
  Everyone stayed aligned, which helped resolve issues quickly and prevented misunderstandings.

- **We had effective team collaboration.**  
  This made task allocation smoother and improved coordination among team members.

# What did not work this week?

- **We had trouble assigning equal weight to everyone.**  
  Since we are still figuring out the workload, the distribution may not always be even.

- **Although we planned early, we checked the requirements too late.**  
  This led to a last-day sprint. We were too confident in our first PR and overlooked some details in the requirements. We should check the requirements earlier next time.
