# What worked this week?

- **We planned earlier in the week.**
  This gave us more time to discuss tasks, allocate work, and adjust as needed.

- **We created rulesets to allow only PRs with approval to merge into the main branch.**
  This helped maintain code quality and ensured that every change was reviewed before merging.

> Good!

- **We fully used issues and PR requests throughout the process.**
  This improved organization, making it easier to track progress and collaborate efficiently.

> Great. It makes it easier for me to follow what the team has completed.

- **Communication was smooth.**
  Everyone stayed aligned, which helped resolve issues quickly and prevented misunderstandings.

- **We had effective team collaboration.**  
  This made task allocation smoother and improved coordination among team members.

# What did not work this week?

- **We had trouble assigning equal weight to everyone.**
  Since we are still figuring out the workload, the distribution may not always be even.

> For the start of the project this is ok. As the team progresses and more components are completed this will change. Keep a look out to ensure that for each spring team members have about the same amount of work.

- **Although we planned early, we checked the requirements too late.**
  This led to a last-day sprint. We were too confident in our first PR and overlooked some details in the requirements. We should check the requirements earlier next time.

> This happens and expect it to happen even if the team does keep track of reqruirements. Part of agile is exactly this, the ability to realize and adopt to changes.

# Design updates

> If changes have been made to the overall design approach for the project this week, list the updates here. Link to documents (or updates to documents) that describe in detail what these changes are.
