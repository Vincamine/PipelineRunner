# What worked this week?
1. We realized the design is different from what we do, so we changed the design to make it more organized and easier to maintain.
2. we catched up with setting backend, database and docker setup. That's a lot of work so that we are happy to see the progress.
3. We updated lots of devs-logs to help us understand the project better. So that we could be one same page

# What did not work this week?
1. Due the complicated setup, we had to let one person set up and commit a big PR. That also consumed a lot of time.We should evaluate the work load before deciding to do this. Because of that we could not finish all the tasks we planned for this week.
# Design updates
We changed to multi-module project structure to make the project more organized and easier to maintain.

> If changes have been made to the overall design approach for the project this week, list the updates here. Link to documents (or updates to documents) that describe in detail what these changes are.
