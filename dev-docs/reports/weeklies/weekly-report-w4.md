# What worked this week?
1. We assigned the issues very early with the requirement published; so that we can started the tasks as soon as possible. 
2. We checked the past code and adjust the folder structures to ensure that it's reasonable and everything is in the correct position; also we improved javadoc to more detail. This would help long-term development so that's good. 

# What did not work this week?

1. Although we assigned the tasks very early, but still have one member didn't start early enough so the other person relating to the issues did the whole part. 

# Design updates

> If changes have been made to the overall design approach for the project this week, list the updates here. Link to documents (or updates to documents) that describe in detail what these changes are.
