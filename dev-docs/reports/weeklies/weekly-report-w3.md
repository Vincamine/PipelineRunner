# What worked this week?

1. We assigned and reviewed requirement earlier than last week, we improved from last week, so this worked. We had a file created during the requirement review meeting and assigning issue with details, so that each of us can create our own issues.
2. We sccussfully have a demo ready to show the client, this worked because now we understand how to do the demo.
3. We helped each other while others may have class dues, we are all helped and flexiable, so this worked.

> Great! Keep these ideas going forward.

# What did not work this week?

1. After assigning issues, there was one issue that is the top of a chain of issues, however, we did not communicate clear and well about that, led to a delay for the tasks. We solved by found this problem, and start the issues immediately by the person who had time.

> This happens naturally. Make sure you spend some time figuring out dependencies in the issues before the sprint starts. Put those dependencies in the issues themselves and make sure team members are aware so that they can start work early to unblock others.  

2. We found more and more conflicts may happen for the PR, because of the communication was not frequent and in real-time. I think that it would be better to inform everyone know which files you will change while begin the issue, or when you suddenly found you need to change, so that the other person may be informed and not suprised when PR request.

> This might be hard since it is difficult to keep all the source code in your head :). Another idea is to branch of main, work in smaller diffs and send those for review. That makes it clear to everyone which files are being worked on. Smaller changes also have less chances for conflicts.

# Design updates

> If changes have been made to the overall design approach for the project this week, list the updates here. Link to documents (or updates to documents) that describe in detail what these changes are.

> So I have not seen any changes in the other repositories owned by the team. I am also not clear on what in the demo was mocked or not. Are we still following the original design here?
